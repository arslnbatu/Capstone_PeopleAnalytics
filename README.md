# **People Analytics Turnover Analytics Project**

## **Project Overview**
Welcome to the People Analytics Turnover Analytics project in the Data Science Nanodegree! In this project, you will learn how to build a model that can be used within a Python to process real-world, user-supplied data. Given employee data, your algorithm will identify patterns and predict employee turnover. If supplied with new data, the code will provide insights into potential turnover risks.

## **Sample Output**
Along with exploring state-of-the-art machine learning models for classification and prediction, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your application. Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a valuable user experience!

## **Project Instructions**

## **Instructions**
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/people-analytics-turnover.git](https://github.com/arslnbatu/Capstone_PeopleAnalytics.git)
cd people-analytics-turnover

Download the employee dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/Capstone_PeopleAnalytics/Archive (1). The Archive (1)/ folder should contain relevant data files.
Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the README in the program repository.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
jupyter notebook people-analytics.ipynb

NOTE: While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.
(Optionally) Accelerating the Training Process
If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen model architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU. If you’d like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

Amazon Web Services
You can use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money, but enrolled students should see a coupon code in their student resources.)

## Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the People Analytics project rubric. Review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.

## **Project Submission**
Your submission should consist of the GitHub link to your repository. Your repository should contain:

The people-analytics.ipynb file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
